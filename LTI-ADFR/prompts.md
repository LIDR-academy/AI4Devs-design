# First prompt

You are an expert Business Analyst. I want you to help me in the definition of the best ATS (Applicant Tracking System). This ATS must add improvements such as:
- increase the HR departments productivity.
- Improve the real time collaboration between recruiters and managers (that are the owners of the job positions).
- Automations in the process.
- AI assistance in specific tasks. 

I would like you to focus in these 3 goals:
1. A description of the Applican Tacking System and the main competitor tools or existing ATSs.
2. Added value of the ATS.
3. Competitive advantages of our ATS proposal.
